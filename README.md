# math4460-spring-2023

This is my repository of problem sets, exams, and other notes when teaching MATH4460 Complex Variables in Boston College, in Spring 2023. I used the first half of the famous Ahlfors' _Complex Analysis_ book (not included). Feel free to take a look inside, there are some nice problems in the problem sets and exams (in my opinion).
